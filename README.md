# Calculator

---

## Objective

The goal of this project was to create a working calculator.

The main goals were to:

- The ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide
- Use HTML and CSS to create a UI
  - Include all of the numbers, the basic operations, an equals sign and a clear button
- A working display
- Perform operations left to right
- Error catching for:
  - Dividing by zero
  - Displaying long numbers

In addition to the main goals to challenge myself I also added the following:

- A working backspace button
- A history display
- The ability to use decimals
- Error catching for entering the decimal key more than necessary

  #### Abilities Demonstrated

  - Problem Solving
  - Research how to use various JS functions
  - Good programming techniques
  - Browser developer tools
  - Staying within project scope
  - Using Bootstrap
  - JS Array Manipulation
    - Store input in array
    - Loop over the array
    - Pull elements out of the array
    - Splice the array
  - JS Events
  - Basic Error Handling

## Overview

This project was extremely difficult for me. I would get stuck on a single issue, find a way to solve it but create 3 other issues elsewhere in my code. Often the issues created were items I thought were complete, but were affected by new code. Even with the project being difficult it was enjoyable when getting the "Eureka!" moments and finally conquering a problem.

I decided to use Bootstrap on this project to try it out. I had had some exposure long ago when I first tried to learn Front-End Web Development and CSS is my least favorite part so it seemed like a good opportunity. I feel like designing my page was extremely simple, it actually took less time than many of my previous projects. Overall, I really enjoyed using Bootstrap, I use similar to use similar frameworks from now on.

My biggest struggle this project was getting all the calculator logic operating correctly at the same time and staying within the project scope.
As mentioned above many times I'd get a function working correctly, only to find out I broke another piece of my code elsewhere. This lead me to take a good look at my script and ensure every piece typed is required and how everything interacted. Once I sat down and did that things came together easier but I still had to work through the issues and test through every function even if I thought it was complete before.
Which leads me a bit to staying in project scope. I had looked at previous Calculator projects and had seen a few things that I also thought would be cool to implement. Unfortunately, this led me to doing more than what was asked and probably greatly extending the time this should have taken me. I'm proud of the extra items I implemented, however they're weren't actually required.

  #### Items I'd like to improve on for future projects:

- Improve ability with JS Arrays.
  - I feel like the lessons leading to this project were a little lost on me for a long time
  - I also feel like I didn't take good advantages of the abilities of arrays
- Staying within project scope.
  - I have a tendency to get excited about extra features instead of getting done what was required and then doing additional features.
- Good programming techniques
  - I string together code and often have to return to correct it at a later time or when I discover something interferes
  - Would like to get in the habit of doing this while I'm working instead of after.
  - I feel like improvement was made, I definitely tried to make use of the DRY principle, but would like to continue to improve.
